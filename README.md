# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks examples and lecture solutions  

The codes are written used by Visual Studio Code and Python 3.7.3 (Most likely other versions are compatible)  
The codes have dependencies for numpy and matplotlib. You can install them using pip or conda. For further examples torch is used.  
If you have any issues on running codes in your computer you can prefer "Google Colab", beware it is in Jupyter Notebook format.
