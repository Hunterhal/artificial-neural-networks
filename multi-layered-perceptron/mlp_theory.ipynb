    "The multi layer perceptron is shown above. This MLP has 3 inputs 4 neurons at first layer, 2 neurons at second layer, and two neurons at output layer with tanh activation functions. Please refer to Perceptron/Adaline section. The circles with b are representing the bias term. All the connections inside the network are weights that are the learnable parameters including bias weights. The single weight is represented as $w_{current,in}^{layer}$. In this representation the current is the index of the neuron in the layer, in is the index of previous neurron or bias, and lastly layer is the index of the layer. For example, the purple connection is $w_{3,1}^{0}$ since it is the weight of neuron 3 in the layer 0 and connected to previous neuron 1. Likewise green connection is $w_{1,4}^{1}$ since it is the weight of neuron 1 in the layer 1 and connected to previous neuron 4 or bias."
